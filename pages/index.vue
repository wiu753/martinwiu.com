      Hey there! My name is Martin Wiu, I'm a Norwegian web developer studying
      software engineering. In my free time I'm either lifting weights or
      working on freelance projects. I also like reading books about finance and
      self-improvement.

      I have work experience with Vue, Laravel and MySQL but I'm transitioning
      into Node, Express and MongoDB. If you want to know some more details
      about me I have a document that I frequently update
